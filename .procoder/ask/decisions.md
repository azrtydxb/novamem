## PR #248 has sat open and BLOCKED for two weeks — what now?

The procoder-audit + TS→Go migration branch (25 commits) is still open.
All checks passed except `docker (arm64)`, a required check that was
queued because the ARC runners were down. Copilot never reviewed it —
it declined at over 20,000 lines, so the automated review CLAUDE.md
relies on never engaged.

Options:

- Re-check `docker (arm64)` and merge (squash + delete branch) if the
  required checks are now green.
- Split the branch into per-theme PRs so Copilot can actually review it,
  then merge those.
- Leave the PR alone and start on the open issues (#139 telemetry
  dashboard, #140 backup/restore verification).
- Leave everything as is for now.

**Decision (2026-09-10, owner):** re-check `docker (arm64)` and merge if
the required checks are green. Copilot's missing review is accepted.

**Outcome (2026-09-10):** merged as fd853b9 (squash), branch deleted.
`docker (arm64)` had not failed on its merits — it was cancelled after
24h queued with no runner. Once runners returned, two advisories
published since 24 Aug blocked it instead: CVE-2026-56854 (CRITICAL,
golang.org/x/crypto 0.52.0 → 0.55.0, caught by Trivy) and six HIGH
fast-uri advisories (→ 4.1.4, caught by pnpm audit). Both fixed; all 12
checks green at merge.

## How far to take the deprecated-package cleanup?

Four TypeScript packages (~6,568 LOC) are superseded by Go and still in
the tree, still pulling npm dependencies we pay to patch — the fast-uri
advisory just fixed came from `packages/mcp`, which `go/cmd/novamem-mcp`
already replaced.

Two recorded decisions currently gate deleting them:

- **ADR 0002** — publish a final npm version carrying the deprecation
  README, THEN delete. Note `npm deprecate` marks already-published
  versions and needs no source, so deleting first does not prevent
  deprecating; it only skips the final README-bearing release.
- **ADR 0004** — reproduce a published benchmark number in the Go
  harness BEFORE deleting `packages/benchmarks`, so docs/benchmarks/
  claims stay reproducible. The model endpoint is reachable again, so
  this is now possible rather than blocked.

Options:

- Delete client + mcp + init now; keep benchmarks until the Go harness
  reproduces a published number (honours ADR 0004, ends most of the
  maintenance).
- Delete all four now, accepting that the published benchmark numbers
  lose their original harness.
- Publish the final deprecation versions first (owner action), then
  delete everything.
- Delete nothing yet.

**Decision (2026-09-10, owner):** delete client + mcp + init now; keep
`packages/benchmarks` until the Go harness reproduces a published
number (ADR 0004 still stands, and the models are reachable again).
